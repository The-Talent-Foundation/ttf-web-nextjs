**(B. The Problem — Cost of Unfilled Seats)**

## When Key Roles Sit Empty, the Meter Spins

- **Project & revenue slip.**  
    _Accordion:_ Each month a critical vacancy delays a launch or transformation, burning **$50-200 k+** in lost opportunity.
    
- **Agency mismatch.**  
    _Accordion:_ Generic recruiters miss niche requirements, flood inboxes, and charge **15-25 % fees** for talent that won’t stick.
    
- **Team overload.**  
    _Accordion:_ Sudden hiring surges drain your internal TA bandwidth, causing burnout and interview bottlenecks.
    
- **Costly mis-hires.**  
    _Accordion:_ Rushed decisions drain **30-150 % of salary** and force painful do-overs when you can least afford them.
    

Patch contracts and speed-first shortcuts backfire. Accelerate replaces scramble with disciplined velocity.
