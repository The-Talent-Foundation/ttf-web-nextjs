- **BP1 (Head of TA):** _Goal: Solve complex hiring/build function._ _Entry: Search, LinkedIn, Referral._
    
    - Path: Lands on Homepage/Service page. Needs to quickly grasp the "Enablement" approach (Homepage, Services Overview). Needs to find solutions for specific pains (Innovate for process, Elevate for skills, Accelerate for speed - linked from Overview). Needs credibility (About Us). Needs resources (Insights). Path to Contact Us clear.
    - _Validation (without Case Studies):_ The structure works. Credibility relies heavily on About Us, clear articulation of the IIEA services, and potentially valuable content in Insights. Messaging needs to strongly convey expertise and the enablement difference.
- **BP4 (CEO):** _Goal: Ensure talent enables strategy, de-risk._ _Entry: Outreach Landing Page (likely Service page), Referral._
    
    - Path: Lands on specific Service page or Homepage. Needs high-level strategic value prop quickly (Homepage, Services Overview). Needs context/credibility (About Us, Who We Serve). Needs clear CTA (Contact Us).
    - _Validation (without Case Studies):_ Structure supports finding key info. The _content_ on landing pages/Homepage must immediately convey business impact and de-risking. Proof will need to be woven into service descriptions or About Us narrative for now.
- **BP2 (PE Partner):** _Goal: Accelerate VCP, find scalable PE-savvy partners._ _Entry: Peer Referral, Event._
    
    - Path: Likely lands on Homepage. Needs immediate signal TF understands PE context (critical Homepage message, Who We Serve). Needs to understand scalability/ROI potential (Services Overview, Innovate, Accelerate). Needs credibility (About Us).
    - _Validation (without Case Studies):_ Structure allows navigation, but the _lack of explicit PE case studies_ is a significant gap for this persona. Content on "Who We Serve" and potentially service pages must strongly address the PE/VC context and VCP alignment to compensate initially.
- **BP3 (CTO):** _Goal: Get quality tech talent fast, reduce HM burden._ _Entry: Internal Referral._
    
    - Path: Likely explores Services Overview, Accelerate, Elevate. Needs technical credibility (About Us bio helps, service descriptions need tech focus). Needs to see how TF makes _their_ life easier (benefit-driven content).
    - _Validation (without Case Studies):_ Structure works. Content is key â€“ must demonstrate understanding of tech hiring nuances and benefits for engineering teams.
- **BP5 (Hiring Manager):** _Goal: Get good hires fast for their team, less wasted time._ _Entry: Internal Link._
    
    - Path: Directed to relevant Service page (e.g., Accelerate, Elevate for training) or process info (potentially within Innovate description). Needs clear "What's in it for me?" message. May check About Us.
    - _Validation (without Case Studies):_ Structure allows finding relevant info if directed. Content needs clear focus on manager benefits (efficiency, quality).
- **BP6 (CFO):** _Goal: Justify ROI, ensure predictability, control costs._ _Entry: Internal Link/Proposal Review._
    
    - Path: Likely reviews Homepage, Services Overview, specific Service pages mentioned in proposal. Needs financial justification (must be _within_ service content). Needs credibility/stability signals (About Us).
    - _Validation (without Case Studies):_ Structure is adequate. Financial justification (ROI, TCO, predictability) must be explicitly built into the narrative of the relevant service pages, as there's no dedicated results page to rely on initially.
