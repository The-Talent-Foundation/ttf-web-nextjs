**Phase 0: Strategic Foundation (Pre-requisites - Mostly Complete)**

- Confirm Core Identity: **Boutique Talent Enablement Agency**
- Finalize ICPs (1-7) & BPs (1-6) based on V1 analysis & discussion.
- Solidify Service Pillars & Offerings (Illuminate, Innovate, Elevate, Accelerate).
- Reconfirm Website Business Goals (e.g., Generate X qualified discovery calls per month from target ICPs).

**Phase 1: Website Strategy & Architecture (Adding Critical Upfront Layers)**

1. **Step 1a: High-Level Persona Goals & Entry Points:** Let's quickly identify the primary goal and potential entry points for maybe 2-3 key BPs when they might encounter the TF website.
    
    - _Example BP1 (Head of TA):_ Goal: Find expert help to fix broken TA function/solve specific challenge (niche hiring, scaling). Entry: Organic search ("TA transformation consultant," "niche tech recruiting help"), Referral, LinkedIn.
    - _Example BP4 (CEO/COO):_ Goal: Validate solution recommended by TA Lead / Find partner to de-risk strategic initiative (growth, M&A). Entry: Direct navigation (from recommendation), Outreach Landing Page, High-level search ("talent strategy for PE portfolio").
    - _Example BP2 (PE/VC Partner):_ Goal: Find scalable talent solutions for portfolio companies / Vet potential partners. Entry: Peer referral, Direct navigation, Industry event follow-up. _(This takes 5-10 minutes but grounds us in user intent)._
- **Step 1b: Draft Preliminary Sitemap:** Based on those high-level needs, our confirmed Service Pillars (IIEA), and standard best practices, let's draft a _simple, preliminary_ sitemap.
    
    - _Initial Draft Idea (similar to your previous thoughts):_
        - Homepage
        - About Us (Who We Are, Our Approach/Values, Adam's Bio)
        - Services
            - Overview (The Enablement Ecosystem)
            - Illuminate (Market Intelligence)
            - Innovate (Process Design/Build)
            - Elevate (Training/Upskilling)
            - Accelerate (Execution Support)
        - Who We Serve (Target ICPs/Industries/Challenges)
        - Results / Case Studies
        - Insights / Resources (For lead magnets)
        - Contact Us
- **Step 1c: Quick Journey Validation:** Now, let's briefly trace those high-level BP paths through this draft sitemap.
    
    - Does BP1 entering via search easily find solutions for their specific pain points (e.g., Innovate for broken process, Accelerate/Elevate for niche skills)? Is the path to "Results" clear?
    - Does BP4 landing on a service page from outreach get enough context and credibility quickly? Is the path to understanding the _overall_ approach and seeing "Results" easy?
    - Can BP2 quickly grasp the strategic value and see proof applicable to portfolio companies? _(This allows us to spot obvious structural flaws or gaps informed by user needs)._
- **Step 1d: Refine Sitemap:** Make any necessary adjustments based on the quick validation.
2. **Develop Core Messaging Architecture & Narrative:**
    - Define the central storyline for TF's value proposition (Enablement Ecosystem).
    - Establish messaging hierarchy: Core value prop -> Service pillar benefits -> Specific features/proof points.
    - Define Tone of Voice (Expert, Strategic, Empathetic, Results-Oriented).
    - _(ROI Link: Ensures consistent, compelling communication of value, builds trust)._
3. **Develop Foundational SEO Strategy:**
    - Conduct keyword research targeting ICP/BP pains, goals, and TF solutions.
    - Map high-level keyword themes to proposed site structure/content areas.
    - Define preliminary URL structure and site hierarchy principles.
    - _(ROI Link: Drives qualified organic traffic from target audiences actively seeking solutions)._
4. **Develop Sitemap:**
    - _Collaboratively define essential pages based on TF Services (Overview + IIEA pages), Audience Needs (Who We Serve), Proof (Case Studies), Strategy (User Journeys, Messaging Arch.), and SEO._
    - _Example Refined Sitemap:_ Homepage, About, Services (Overview), Illuminate, Innovate, Elevate, Accelerate, Who We Serve (ICPs), Results/Case Studies, Insights/Resources, Contact. _(Blog decision separate)_.
    - _(ROI Link: Provides logical structure aligned with user needs and SEO)._
5. **Define Measurement & Analytics Plan:**
    - Identify specific, measurable KPIs (e.g., Discovery Call submissions via site, conversion rates by key page/CTA, traffic source quality, engagement metrics).
    - Plan necessary Google Analytics (or other tool) setup (goals, events).
    - _(ROI Link: Enables tracking of website performance against business goals, informs optimization)._

**Phase 2: Content Strategy & Design Input**

6. **Outline Key Page Structures & Content Briefs:**
    - _(As you proposed, but critically informed by Steps 1-5)._ For each core page:
        - Page Goal (Specific, Measurable - linking to KPIs if possible).
        - Target Audience(s) (Primary/Secondary BPs).
        - Key Message (Aligned with overall Messaging Architecture).
        - Role in User Journey / Conversion Path.
        - Target Keywords.
        - Essential Sections/Content Blocks (Addressing BP pains/goals, TF solutions, EVP data, differentiators, trust elements, linking to next steps in journey).
        - Primary & Secondary CTAs.
    - _(ROI Link: Ensures content is strategically crafted for conversion, resonance, and SEO)._
7. **Develop Lead Magnet & Resource Strategy:**
    - Identify 2-3 high-value content offers (e.g., "TA Scalability Checklist," "Niche Hiring Playbook," "Calculating Talent ROI Guide") targeted at specific BP pains/stages.
    - Plan distribution via Insights/Resources page and potentially as secondary CTAs on service pages.
    - Define lead capture mechanism.
    - _(ROI Link: Captures leads earlier in funnel, nurtures prospects, demonstrates expertise)._
8. **Create Comprehensive Design Brief:**
    - Package outputs from Phase 1 & 2 (Sitemap, User Journeys, Messaging Arch, Page Briefs, Brand Guidelines, Measurement Goals) as clear, actionable input for UI/UX designer.
    - _(ROI Link: Ensures design supports usability, conversion goals, and brand identity)._

**Phase 3: Design, Content Creation & Development**

9. UI/UX Design (Wireframes, Mockups, Prototypes - Consider lightweight usability testing here if budget/time allows).
10. Content Creation (Compelling copywriting based _strictly_ on briefs, visual asset creation).
11. Website Development & Technical SEO Implementation.
12. Analytics & Goal Tracking Implementation.

**Phase 4: Launch & Continuous Optimization**

13. Pre-launch QA & Testing (Functional, Content, SEO, Analytics).
14. Launch Website.
15. **Monitor KPIs & Analyze User Behavior:** Track performance against goals defined in Step 5. Use analytics, heatmaps, etc., to understand what's working/not working.
16. **Iterate & Optimize:** Based on data, make targeted improvements to content, CTAs, user flows, or design elements to continuously enhance conversion rates and ROI. (Plan for regular review cycles).
