**(B. The Problem — Cost of Stagnant Skills)**

## When Capability Lags, Execution (and Revenue) Suffer

- **Strategic incapability drag.**  
    _Accordion:_ Out-of-date skills throttle delivery on growth initiatives, putting launches and expansions at risk.
    
- **AI adoption gap.**  
    _Accordion:_ Competitors wield AI to halve sourcing cycles while your team wrestles with basic prompts—or ignores the tools entirely.
    
- **Tech ROI squandered.**  
    _Accordion:_ A six-to-seven-figure TA stack sees < 50 % adoption, forfeiting **efficiency gains** and leaving data holes executives can’t trust.
    
- **Bad-hire & agency bleed.**  
    _Accordion:_ Weak assessment and agency dependence add **15-25 % fees** and **30 %+ salary losses** per mis-hire—costs that compound quarter after quarter.
    

Skills inertia isn’t a nuisance; it’s a strategic liability. Elevate replaces guess-and-hope with mastery.
