**(B. The Problem – Cost of Blind Spots)**

## When Talent Intelligence Is Missing, Costs Explode

- **Expansion roulette.**  
    _Accordion:_ Unseen competition causing local talent shortages, compliance traps, and pay realities can derail a new market entry before the first hire. Costly delays are draining both budgets and morale.

- **Profit‑draining attrition.**  
    _Accordion:_ Mis‑benchmarked rewards based on flawed compensation reports or unaddressed competitor poaching are fueling double‑digit regrettable turnover and six‑figure replacement costs.
    
- **Competitive ambush.**  
    _Accordion:_ Rival hiring sprints by competitors to dominate the talent market for critical AI or Cyber skills, along with targeted campaigns executed against you, will stall your growth roadmap.
    
- **Strategic surprises.**  
    _Accordion:_ Approving major initiatives (M&A, large-scale transformations) based on *thoughts and opinions,* rather than hard data on talent and market feasibility? You're exposing yourself to costs and delays.

Ignoring talent intelligence doesn’t save money, it causes systemic blindness. Illuminate research service replaces guesswork with data‑driven clarity.
